# Description and evolution of social actors involved in Twitter discussions: case study applied to FP Dual
This repository includes all data processing for the work "*Description and evolution of social actors involved in Twitter discussions: case study applied to FP Dual*".

## Authors

## Data
Twitter data are available, but only includes User ID and Tweet ID, according to Twitter developer policy.

## Jupyter Notebook
The entire data processing workflow is available in a Jupyter Notebook with R. However, to reproduce it correctly it is necessary to recover from Twitter the fields: date (*created_at*), tweet (*text*), replies (*reply_count*), retweets (*retweet_count*) and favs (*favorite_count*). Likewise, to identify each account it is necessary to obtain also the field *screen_name*.
